feat: integrate Loguru logging and global loglevel option

- Rename Typer callback from 'main' to 'cli_callback_main' to avoid conflicts with entry point.
- Add global --loglevel option (with MOKU_LOGLEVEL env var support) to control logging verbosity.
- Update README to document all environment variables, including official and custom ones.
- Add root log redirection to capture logs from the 'moku' module.
- Update pyproject.toml to use 'app' as the CLI entry point.

This commit improves logging flexibility and documentation for the Moku-Go CLI.
